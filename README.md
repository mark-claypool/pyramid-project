**PYRAMID** - solve the maze to escape the mummy guardians!

v2.0

Copyright 2019, Mark Claypool and WPI

This is a class project designed for IMGD 3000 Technical Game
Development I.  The intent is to provide a framework where students
can implement a finite state machine in a game engine.  Students are
given the basic setup of a game with a Hero, a constrained space
filled with Mummy's, mystical Ankh's that should render Mummy's
momentarily paralyzed by fear and an exit to fresh air and freedom.
What is missing is AI, implemented by a state machine, that will see
the Mummy's sense, think and act as they wander, seek and attack the
Hero.

The code is intended to be used with the [Dragonfly game
engine](https://dragonfly.wpi.edu/), as implemented in the
book:

Happy Pyramid plundering!
